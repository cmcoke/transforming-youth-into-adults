During his 13 years on the force, he patrolled and\n                    ensured public safety in high crime areas of the city, participating in approximately 2,500\n                    narcotic arrests and receiving Commendatory Performance Awards for four high profile narcotic\n                    seizures. In 2011 he was forced to retire after an injury in the line of duty. Still wishing to\n                    serve his community, Hill decided to pursue a career in social work and earned a Bachelor of\n                    Social Work, with an emphasis in mental health, from Morgan State University and a Master of\n                    Social Work from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. During this period, Hill interned as an\n                    Independent Living Specialist for King Edwards Inc., where he helped youths and young adults\n                    find\n                    employment and located resources that helped improve their quality of life.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p class="paragraph paragraph--small paragraph__mb">\n                    Hill\'s work with King Edwards Inc. opened his eyes to the services foster care youths continue\n                    to\n                    need once they age out of the foster system. This inspired him to create the non-profit\n                    Transforming Youths Into Adults (TYIA) in 2019, where he serves as the Executive Director. In\n                    this\n                    role, Hill oversees company operations and ensures TYIA employees and business practices comply\n                    with regulatory and legal requirements. He also identifies potential sources of investment and\n                    organizes fundraising efforts, all while managing employees from diverse backgrounds in every\n                    departmentâ€”from public relations and fundraising to administration and accounting. The most\n                    rewarding part of his work with TYIA has been supporting foster care youth that identify as\n                    LGBTQ+\n                    with safe houses that address their daily needs, and the development of the After Youth Program.\n                    This unique program will help current and former foster youths purchase newly renovated\n                    low-income\n                    houses at low or 0% interest rates.\n                  </p>\n\n                  <p class="paragraph paragraph--small paragraph__mb">\n                    Hill also expanded TYIA\'s therapy services by developing the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Program\n                    (PRP), which supports the psychotherapeutic aspect of an individual\'s mental health treatment by\n                    addressing what happens internally, mentally, and emotionally. Overall, the services Hill has\n                    created at TYIA help children and adults become as independent as possible in the living,\n                    learning, working and social environments of their choice. Outside of his work with TYIA, Hill\n                    is\n                    a licensed realtor in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. He spends his free time with\n                    his\n                    family and enjoys traveling, fishing, cooking and watching sporting events.\n                  </p>\n\n                </div>\n\n              </div>\n\n            </div>\n\n          </div>\n    ')}}])&&i(n.prototype,a),Object.defineProperty(n,"prototype",{writable:!1}),e}()}}]);
