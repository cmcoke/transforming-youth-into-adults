Foster care youth are particularly vulnerable in terms of finding affordable, safe housing after they leave care.</p><p class="paragraph">Founder Kareen Hill therefore decided to set up Transforming Youths Into Adults, with the goal of providing connections to community and PRP support, life skills, education and career pathways, and access to wraparound permanent housing services.</p><p class="paragraph">Since then, the organization has grown in scope, forming connections with institutions such as Race Forward and the RISE program from the Los Angeles LGBT center. By forming a web of positive connections with other organizations and initiatives already dedicated to serving youth, we believe we will be able to provide the “growing-up experiences” so many foster youth lack.</p></div></div><div class="col-12" id="about-us-page-second-section-second-text-content"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="heading">Mission Statement</h3><p class="paragraph">At Transforming Youths Into Adults, our mission is to change the landscape of homelessness for youth in foster care with connections to community support, life skills, education, and access to wraparound permanent housing services.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="about page-section page-section__black-background page-section__orange-top-border page-section__orange-bottom-border" id="about-us-page-third-section"><div class="container" id="about-us-page-third-section-heading"><h1 class="heading heading--center heading--white">Philosophy and Values</h1></div><div class="container" id="about-us-page-third-section-first-content"><div class="about__icon-and-text-content about__color-gradient-on-right"><div class="grid align-center"><div class="about__icon col-12 col-md-3"><img class="lazyload" data-srcset="assets/images/icon--eai.png" alt="Equality and Inclusion Icon"></div><div class="col-12 col-md-9"><h4 class="heading">Equality and Inclusion</h4><p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Every young adult deserves access to the same opportunities in life. Foster care youth often find themselves disadvantaged in many regards when they age out of the foster care system; at TYIA, we aim to “bridge the gap”, preparing and supporting these young people in their transition into society and ensuring they enter the adult world on an equal footing with their peers.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">It is a sad reality that BIPOC and LGBTQ youths often experience even greater difficulties and are more likely to face homelessness and social exclusion, due to systematic, societal and individual prejudices. At TYIA, we have specialized support groups for these young people in which we provide emotional and mental support, teaching how to navigate institutional prejudice and embrace our identities and self-concepts. Our “safe spaces” program also provides dedicated housing opportunities for LGBTQ foster care youth.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="container" id="about-us-page-third-section-second-content"><div class="about__icon-and-text-content about__color-gradient-on-left"><div class="grid align-center"><div class="about__icon col-12 col-md-3"><img class="lazyload" data-srcset="assets/images/icon--mh.png" alt="Mental Health Icon"></div><div class="col-12 col-md-9"><h4 class="heading">Mental Health</h4><p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Mental health support is an essential component in the transition from foster care to society. At TYIA, we offer a dedicated psychiatric rehabilitation program, or PRP, for foster youths. We work hand in hand with therapists to determine and provide the most effective therapeutic solutions for each individual in a supportive and compassionate environment. We also provide interventions to help participants access community resources and the best available psychiatric support.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Dedicated support and therapy are vital in helping foster care youths attain the psychological and spiritual stability necessary to begin their adult life, whether they wish to study or go straight into employment. We supplement this with our skills training sessions and housing support programs, directly tackling the causes of many stresses and anxieties that can trigger mental health issues in the first place.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="container" id="about-us-page-third-section-third-content"><div class="about__icon-and-text-content about__color-gradient-on-right"><div class="grid align-center"><div class="about__icon col-12 col-md-3"><img class="lazyload" data-srcset="assets/images/icon--com.png" alt="Community Icon"></div><div class="col-12 col-md-9"><h4 class="heading">Community</h4><p class="paragraph paragraph--medium">Foster care youths are deserving and valuable members of their local communities, just as any other young person is. Nonetheless, upon emerging from the foster care system, they can often feel a sense of isolation and lack of community belonging. Inclusivity enriches our community as a whole, and no-one deserves to feel left out. This is why at TYIA we work hard to help these young people integrate into society, teaching them the skills necessary to access the same opportunities as everyone else. Through our Community Support Services and Community Integration Program, our team helps foster care youths to bridge the gap and gain the confidence to know and feel that they belong.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="page-section" id="about-us-page-fourth-section"><div class="container"><div class="grid"><div class="col-12"><div class="wrapper"><h3 class="heading heading--center heading--green-line">How you can help today</h3><p class="paragraph">With a donation, you can help fund essential mental health services for foster youths.
