                TYIA is a 501(c)(3) organization specializing in youth foster care support. Our goal is to help our most
                vulnerable youth transition into society as independent adults. Founded by owner and Executive Director
                Kareen Hill in 2019, we provide a wide range of community integration services for youth aged 18-24
                throughout Maryland. In addition, Director Hill, a MSW graduate, is the proud owner of a Psychiatric
                Rehabilitation Program, and TYIA's youth and young adults will also have access to PRP services while
                participating in our non-profit programs.

                As mental health practitioners, we understand that mental health and well-being are not isolated
                elements
                but are deeply linked to aspects such as physical, social and spiritual well-being, and to occupational
                and educational stability. This strongly informs our holistic approach to foster care support. We help
                youth become economically and socially self-sufficient and successful adults, addressing any behavioral
                health issues and providing innovative interventions to help foster care youth access the help and
                resources they need.
